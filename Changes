    * handle predicate => 1, clearer => 1 as well

    * Convert our trait to a parameterized role, to allow for different
      build and writer prefixes (e.g. '_set_' vs '_')
    * Cause 'is => "lazy"' to behave the way it does in Moo
    * Change the default writer prefix from _ to _set_; it was pointed out
      that this is the expected way to do things (and makes more sense,
      really).
